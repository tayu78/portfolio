            Iâ€™m a Japanese developer who graduated from Electrical Engineering
            and Computer Science department in University.
            <br />I have 1 year and 3 months of professional experience in
            software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            My coding journey started at my university days with learning C.
            <br />
            On my graduation thesis about automatic control of anesthesia, I
            used Python to utilize library good for managing and visualizing
            actual patient&apos;s data.

          <p>
            After graduated university, I worked as Full Stack Developer
            specializing React.js and Node.js in Japan. Besides developing
            application using React.js and Node.js, I was in charged of DevOps
            by myself without previous knowledge. These experience gave me
            confidence about learning new technology even if I&apos;m not
            familiar with that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to move to Vancouver to achieve my desire working diverse
            culture and put myself on environment in North America where tech
            industry is big.
